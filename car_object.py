# design a program that creates a Car object then calls the accelerate method five times.
# after each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
# then, call the brake method for five times.
# after each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.

# pseudocode
# import class from the module created
from car import Car
# implement functions
def main():
    # establish the object of the car
    car = Car(2005, "Chevrolet Equinox")
    
  # call the program to accelerate, five times
  # call the program to brake, five times
  # check for errors
