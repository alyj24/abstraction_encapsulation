# Abstraction and Encapsulation
Assignment 9, Module 6
# Problem
```
This github has a three problem or program and these are:
1.) Create a class named "Fan" that has three constant named SLOW, MEDIUM, and FAST with the values 1, 2, and 3 to denote the fan speed.
Has given accessor(getters)  and mutator(setters)  methods for all four data fields of speed, radius, color, and if the fan is switched on or not.
After the established class, write a test program named TestFan that creates two Fan objects. For the first object, assign the maximum speed, radius 10, color yellow, and turn it on. Assign medium speed, radius 5, color blue, and turn it off for the second object. Display each object’s speed, radius, color, and on properties.

```

```
2.) Writing a class named Car with the data attributes of year model, make, and speed. The class should also have the following methods:
• accelerate method should add 5 to the speed data attribute each time it is called.
• brake method should subtract 5 from the speed data attribute each time it is called.
• get_speed method should return the current speed.

Then, design a program that creates a Car object then calls the accelerate method five times. After each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and display it. Then call the brake method five times. After each call to the brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
```

```
3.) Writing a class named Pet with the data attributes of name, animal type, and age. It should also have the following methods:
• this method assigns a value to the _ _name field.
• this method assigns a value to the _ _animal_type field.
• this method assigns a value to the _ _age field.
• this method returns the value of the _ _ name field.
• this method returns the value of the _ _animal_type field.
• this method returns the value of the _ _age field.

Subsequently, write a program that creates an object of the class and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet. This data should be stored as the object’s attributes. Use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve the pet’s name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.

# Importance of the Lesson
Abstraction is a design-level process and it is used to reduce the complexity at the designing stage of a project.. Abstraction is a feature of OOPs that hides unnecessary detail but shows essential information.

Encapsulation is an implementation-level process, and it is used to provide privacy and maintain control over the transparency of data at the implementation stage of a project. Encapsulation is also a feature of OOPs. It hides the code and data into a single entity or unit so that the data can be protected from the outside world. It solves an issue at the design level.

# Execution
• Accessor Method: This method is used to access the state of the object i.e, the data hidden in the object can be accessed from this method. However, this method cannot change the state of the object, it can only access the data hidden. We can name these methods with the word get.
get() 
 
• Mutator Method: This method is used to mutate/modify the state of an object i.e, it alters the hidden value of the data variable. It can set the value of a variable instantly to a new value. This method is also called as update method. Moreover, we can name these methods with the word set. 
set() 

• __init__()

• accelerate()

• brake()

• get_speed()
