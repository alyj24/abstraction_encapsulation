class Fan:
  # implement the fan speed
  '''Three constants that will set with values to denote the fan speed.'''
  SLOW = 1
  MEDIUM = 2
  FAST = 3
  # establish the constructor
  # construct the accessor and mutator methods for all four private data fields
  # speed of the fan
  # on-switch of the fan
  # radius of the fan
  # color of the fan
